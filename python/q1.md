Bug was coming from the fact that method Shop.can_order was returning True instead of False when user wasn't verified.
Also, test "test_cannot_order_if_not_verified" wasn't catching the issue because the method Shop.can_order was not 
returning False because user used in test is underage so the test wasn't really testing the verified condition but the age one.
